# Recipe Finder App

A responsive web application to discover recipes by name, ingredient, or category. The app features a modern UI inspired by mobile app designs, including a clean search bar, category filters, dynamic recipe cards, and a detailed recipe modal. Powered by TheMealDB API.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Recipe Search:** Find recipes by typing a recipe name or ingredient into the search bar.
* **Category Filters:** Browse recipes by popular categories (e.g., Indian, Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, Thai).
* **Dynamic Recipe Cards:** Displays recipe images, titles, and a placeholder rating for a visually engaging list.
* **Recipe Details Modal:** Click on any recipe card to view detailed instructions, ingredients list, and a link to a YouTube tutorial (if available).

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Structured the web page content semantically.
* **CSS3:** Styled the application, implementing the visual design from the reference image, responsive layouts with `flexbox` and `grid`, and `@media` queries for different screen sizes.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Handled API requests using `fetch()`, parsed JSON responses, dynamically updated the DOM, managed app state, and implemented modal functionality.
* **TheMealDB API:** The public API used for fetching recipe data. **No API key is required for basic search and lookup functionality.**
* **Font Awesome:** Utilized for various icons (search, categories, home, cart, favorite, user, stars, heart, loading, error, etc.).
* **Google Fonts (Montserrat):** For modern and legible typography throughout the application.
